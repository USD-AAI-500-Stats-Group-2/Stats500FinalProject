# Final Project for AAI 500 Statistics, Group 2

This project is a part of the AAI-500 course in the Applied Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of San Diego (USD).

-- Project Status: Completed

## Installation

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the command below:
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/USD-AAI-500-Stats-Group-2/Stats500FinalProject.git
```

## Project Objective
The main purpose of this project is to examine how lifestyle habits and demographic factors influence student academic performance. By modeling relationships between behavioral and demographic variables and academic outcomes, this analysis aims to identify which factors most strongly shape student success. The findings from this work can provide valuable insights for students, educators, and policymakers seeking improve student achievement through effective strategies.

## Contributors
This project was completed by Erika, Joe, and Paul. Individual contributions can be found in the directories erika/ joe/, and paul/.  Each of these jupyter notebook files represents early research and analysis of the dataset then used to generate the final report, slides, and notebook file.

## Methods Used
Data analysis was conducted using exploratory data analysis, linear regression, and binary logistic regression.

## Technologies
Python

## Project Description 
The dataset is a synthetic dataset representing 1,000 students across 14 behavioral and demographic factors, along with their final exam score. This can be found in the /data directory.  It is in CSV format. The following research questions are addressed in this project:   
RQ1: What patterns of association exist among studentsâ€™ habits and background factors?   
RQ2: How do student habits and demographic variables affect exam scores?   
RQ3: What factors are most influential in determining whether a student achieves a passing versus failing exam grade?   

## Environment Setup
For detailed setup and collaboration steps, see the [Environment Setup Guide](./EnvironmentSetup.md)

## Recorded Presentation
A presentation was recorded demonstrating processes, tests, analyses, and other conclusions based on the notebooks found in this repo. This file can be found at "Team 2_Slides.pdf".
